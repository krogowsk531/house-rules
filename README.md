**Project Description**

*A site for disputing game rules where a user can select a game, get information about that game and fill out a form that allows them to dispute a game rule. The rule dispute will persist through local storage in each individual game page so that a user can debate rules for the specified game.

**Project Goals**

* Create a functioning app while learning a new technology
* Decide what the most viable product for the app will be
* Use an external API of the teams choosing
* To have a multipage app using routing

**Wins**

* Learning and working with Next.js in a collaborative environment given a short deadline of a week and a half
* Incorporating Next.js features such as dynamic routing and server side rendering
* Generated a way to bypass server side rendering with client side rendering in order to allow features that a user can interact with
* Integrating regular and custom hooks in order to keep components functional for developer empathy
* Working with an unfamiliar testing suite

**Challenges**

* Testing certain interactions of the app built with Next.js
* Learning how to use custom hooks for the purpose of local storage
* Next.js does not give access to the window object inside of components because it is only available on the browser

**Technologies Used**

* Next.js
* React
* Hooks
* Local Storage
* Jest and React testing libraries
* Webpack and Babel
* Fetch API

**Spec Given**
* https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/stretch.html
